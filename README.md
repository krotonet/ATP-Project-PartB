# Maze Game

![Maze Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

Welcome to the Maze Game project!

## Features

- Maze generation algorithms: The project includes three different maze generation algorithms to create unique and challenging mazes.
- Search algorithms: Implementations of BFS, DFS, and BestFS algorithms allow you to find the optimal path from the start to the goal in the generated mazes.
- Multithreading and Streams: The application efficiently handles maze compression using decorator design pattern, making it suitable for server-client communication.
- Desktop Application with MVVM Architecture: The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using JavaFX and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
  The event-driven programming model provides a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

To run the Maze Game project on your local machine, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd maze-game`
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the game: `java -jar target/maze-game.jar`

## Usage

Once the game is launched, you can:

- Generate a new maze using different algorithms: EmptyMazeGenerator, SimpleMazeGenerator, or MyMazeGenerator.
- Choose a search algorithm (BFS, DFS, or BestFS) to find the optimal path through the maze.
- Interact with the maze using keyboard controls or mouse clicks.
- Explore the graphical interface and enjoy the challenging gameplay.
